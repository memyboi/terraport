# Terraport
Do you ever look at terraria, and just wish it was 100x worse?

Well, introducing:
Porting 3DS/Console Terraria to [tModLoader](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader) 1.4.4.9 - Who needs Quality of Life anyway?

Now, with:
> -260 more mobs  
> -5 more bosses  
> and a whole {please spare me im working on this mod} more items!  

## Warnings:
I'm not claiming that I am amazing at C#. Far from that. Please, if you find any issues with my awful, bloated code, please submit a pull request if you feel like you can change it.

Only one localisation file, that being English (to lower my current workload)  
Polish localisation will be available at full release (likely), but i'd need help from other people to get other languages translated.

## Installation:
Currently no official binaries. It will be released later in this mod's life, when it is ready for distribution. For now, just clone this repo and put it into the modSources folder in tModLoader's steam directory, download .NET 6.0 sdk (a pain to do on linux cuz of microsoft), and press build & compile.

## About:
Recently, I have been getting back into Terraria. I remember playing a WHOLE LOT of terraria on my old PS3 when I was younger. As of late, I no longer know where my old PS3 is, so the only logical solution is to spend months making a mod to bring back that experience that I remember. (I'm not even joking, this is what happens when you have too much freetime)

## Changes:
As of now, not much has been implemented (due to recency).  
Here is a basic, not regularly updated list of what *is* implemented:
- 'Terraport' menu screen option
- Some crafting recipes disabled/changed (not all)
- Shortswords reverted to 1.3 variant
- Added souls of blights, incomplete sprite, dropped from EoC temporarily
- Added Tizona, Tonbogiri (wip), Dragon armour (wip), Titan armour and their crafting recipes.

## Sources:
Obviously, I don't remember EVERYTHING that was in the old console ports.  
Here are a few websites that I used (or that I remember using) to help me make this mod:
https://www.google.co.uk/ ; any frantic googlers here?  
https://stackoverflow.com/ ; incredibly useful source  
https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/terraria/sheet/66755/ ; some sprites ripped directly from the mobile port  
https://terraria.wiki.gg/ ; official wiki. I do use the unofficial wiki occasionally because it just appears higher in search results
https://docs.tmodloader.net/ ; official tmodloader docs. Incredibly useful.
